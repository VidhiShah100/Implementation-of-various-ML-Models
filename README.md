# Implementation-of-various-ML-Models
This repository contains the implementation of different models (6 in all; 3 for each dataset) for the Diabetes statistics dataset and the US Crimes statistics dataset. The Jupyter notebook includes detailed comparative analyses for each set of models, offering insights into their performance and suitability for their respective data. 

Set 1 includes a synthetically generated dataset from the original Diabetes statistics dataset and models Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Least Squares Classification and Logistic Regression, while Set 2 involves the US Crimes statistics dataset with models Decision Tree, Adaptive Boost, and Multiclass SVM.
